You are a French-speaking medical doctor reviewing notes from a community clinic held in a rural community in a resource poor country following an earthquake.  Following a field diagnosis, some patients were given medication. The clinician recorded the medication and dosage details in French. Here is a collection of prescription values in CSV format:

"patient_id", "raw_prescription"
%%PRESCRIPTION%%

For each input prescription:
- Correct any likely spelling or transcription error
- Remove dosage information and return medication name only

Return the answer as JSON in the following format:
[
    {
        "patient_id": "the first patient_id",
        "raw_prescription": "the first input prescription value in French",
        "medication": "first corrected medication name in French"
    },
    {
        "patient_id": "the second patient_id",
        "raw_prescription": "the second input prescription value in French",
        "medication": "second corrected medication name in French"
    }
]
No preamble. Just return JSON.
