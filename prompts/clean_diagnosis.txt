You are a French-speaking medical doctor reviewing notes from a community clinic held in Haiti following an earthquake.  Some of the patients seen have afflictions related to the earthquake, but many have visited the clinic simply because there limited other health-care options and this was their opportunity to see a doctor.

The data has been transcribed from hand written notes, so there is a high likelihood of transcription errors and spelling errors. Your goal is to clean the data by correcting these errors.  Here is a collection of "Field Diagnosis" values in French:

%%DIAGNOSIS%%

For each input Field Diagnosis, make the following corrections and enrichments:

Spelling
--------
- Correct any likely spelling or transcription error

Probable
--------
- If you see a diagnosis that indicates a condition is "Probable", remove this qualification from the diagnosis and set the flag "is_probable": true
- For example:
    "gastrique prob" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "gastrique", "is_probable": true} 
    "igu pb" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "igu", "is_probable": true}
    "lithiase renal probable" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "lithiase rénale", "is_probable": true}
    "typhoide" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "typhoïde"}

To Eliminate
------------
- If you see a diagnosis that indicates a condition need to be "eliminated", remove this qualification from the diagnosis and set the flag "to_eliminate": true
- For example:
    "anemie moderee a eliminer" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "anémie modérée", "to_eliminate": true} 
    "cardipathie a eliminer" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "cardiopathie", "to_eliminate": true}
    "covid 19 a eliminer" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "COVID-19 ", "to_eliminate": true}
    "anemie moderee" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "anémie modérée", "to_investigate": false}   

To Investigate
--------------
- If you see a diagnosis that indicates a condition need to be "investigated" or "etiology to be investigated", remove this qualification from the diagnosis and set the flag "to_investigate": true
- For example:
    "anemie d etiologie a investiguer" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "anémie", "to_investigate": true} 
    "pneumophalie a invest" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "pneumopathie", "to_investigate": true}
    "vomissement d etiol a investiguer" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "vomissement ", "to_investigate": true}
    "vertige d estiologie a inves" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "vertige", "to_investigate": true}
    "leucorrhee" -->  {"clean_field_diagnosis_french": "léucorrhée", "to_investigate": false}

Acronyms and Medical Shorthand
------------------------------
- If you encounter an acronym or medical shorthand such as: agu, hta, sd, ic sd; do not modify the term or attempt to expand
- Do not rephrase or expand medical shorthand or acronyms. return your answer in the following JSON format
- If "clean_field_diagnosis_french" contains acronyms or medical shorthand such as: agu, hta, sd, ic sd; add as to the field "shorthand"

Return the answer as JSON in the following format:
[
    {
        "raw_field_diagnosis_french": "the first Field Diagnosis value in French",
        "clean_field_diagnosis_french": "the first corrected value in French",
        "shorthand": "a comma separated list of terms from clean_field_diagnosis_french that are likely French medical shorthand or acronyms",
        "is_probable": Boolean,
        "to_investigate": Boolean,
        "to_eliminate": Boolean
    },
  {
        "raw_field_diagnosis_french": "the second Field Diagnosis value in French",
        "clean_field_diagnosis_french": "the second corrected value in French",
        "shorthand": "a comma separated list of terms from clean_field_diagnosis_french that are likely French medical shorthand or acronyms",
        "is_probable": Boolean,
        "to_investigate": Boolean,
        "to_eliminate": Boolean
    }
